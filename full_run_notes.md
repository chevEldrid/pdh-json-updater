Certain cards still fall between the cracks in the existing system. After a full re-run make sure to:

- Blightbelly rat should be legal, isPauperCommander
- Snowhorn Rider should be legal
- Mardu Hateblade should be legal

These could be caused by:

- ONE had weird multi-rarity printings in the same set
- KTK has a KTKy that might be mucking up specific printings
