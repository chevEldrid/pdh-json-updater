To set up a virtual environment for development, first [install pypoetry onto your machine](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
From there, you can [install your project dependencies](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies) and
[run any scripts in the library](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#using-poetry-run) within the virtualenv. You can also
[build the contents of the repo into a python .whl](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli#build) which can then be installed anywhere via `pip`
